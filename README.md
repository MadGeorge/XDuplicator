# Xcode Source Editor Extension for a line duplication

- Duplicate a line or multiple of them by beloved ⌘+D or any key bindings you like. Forget about ⌘+C & ⌘+V.
- Delete a line or selection of lines from any caret position without hitting ⌫ twice like a crazy. Just assign a ⌘⇧+D or combination you prefer and enjoy.
- Chop functions declaration with large number of parameters into multiple lines with ⌘⇧+B
